Sublime Text 2/3 Markdown preview
===============================

Preview your markdown files quickly in you web browser from sublime text 2/3. 

You can use builtin [python-markdown2][0] parser (default) or use the [github markdown API][5] for the conversion (edit your settings to select it).

**NOTE:** If you choose the GitHub API for conversion (set parser: github in your settings), your code will be sent through https to github for live conversion. You'll have [Github flavored markdown][6], syntax highlighting and EMOJI support for free :heart: :octocat: :gift:. If you make more than 60 calls a day, be sure to set your GitHub API key in the settings :)

**LINUX users:** If you want to use GitHub API for conversion, you'll need to have a custom Python install that includes python-ssl as its not built in the Sublime Text 2 Linux package. see [@dusteye comment][8]. If you use a custom window manager, also be sure to set a `BROWSER` environnement variable. see [@PPvG comments][9]

## Features :


 - Markdown conversion via builtin Markdown Parser ([python-markdown2][0]) or via Github API or the original [Python-markdown][10]: just choose in your settings.
 - Browser preview auto reload on save if you have the [ST2 LiveReload plugin][7] installed.
 - Builtin parser : Support TOC, footnotes markdown extensions
 - CSS search path for local and build-in CSS files (always enabled) and/or CSS overriding if you need
 - YAML support thanks to @tommi
 - Clipboard selection and copy to clipboard thanks to @hexatrope
 - MathJax support : \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\) thanks to @bps10
